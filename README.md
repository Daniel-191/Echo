2. `cd Echo`

3. Open config.json and do the following:

 - Add your bot token

 - Add your user id for admin commands

 - add your bot invite link (scroll down for all the permissions needed)

4. for windows simply run `win-run.bat` and for linux do the following `chmod +x linux-run.sh` then `./linux-run.sh` (untested I tink those commands work). All requirements will be installed (you can disable this by setting skip-installation to true)
