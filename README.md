# Echo Bot

Just a discord bot I made in python (discord.py library). It contains a large amount of commands and features that you can use with a very fun and addictive economy game!

# DISCLAIMER: This is in beta, there are still many bugs and updates to fix and to release.

# Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/DanielJones02/Echo` or download the latest release

2. IMPORTANT: add your discord token, weather api AND your user id:

Locations
- main.py - add your bot token at the bottom

- cogs/libs.py - add your USER ID there (for admin commands)

- cogs/other.py - Line 39, add your weather api key

2. run main.py `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` for linux users
