# Echo Bot

Just a discord bot I made in python (discord.py library). It contains a large amount of commands and features that you can use with a very fun and addictive economy game!

# DISCLAIMER: This is in beta, there are still many bugs and updates to fix and to release.

# bot probably DOES NOT WORK AS OF THIS MOMMENT

# Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/DanielJones02/Echo` or download the latest release

2. IMPORTANT: add your discord token, weather api AND your user id:

Locations
- main.py - add your bot token at the bottom (ESSENTIAL

- economy.py - add your PATH for the the cogs directory there (ESSENTIAL)

- cogs/libs.py - Line 22, add your USER ID there (ESSENTIAL 4 ADMIN COMMANDS)

- cogs/other.py - Line 39, add your weather api key (not essential but $weather wont work)

2. run main.py `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` for linux users. Requirements will auto be installed. Make sure you have python 3.12 installed with pip 3.12.

3. You're finished! Your bot should ne running smoothly now.
