# Echo Bot

A cool bot with lots and lots of commands and many different features. Scroll down to see the installation and the list of all the commands.

# MAJOR UPDATE COMMING SOON (BUG FIXES)

### todo

make code much neater and remove all DRY (dont repeat yourself)

fix embedding

debug code

make code more flexible and robust

add unmute command

# Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/DanielJones02/Echo` or download the latest release

2. `cd Echo`

3. Open config.json and do the following:

 - Add your bot token

 - Add your user id for admin commands

 - add your bot invite link (scroll down for all the permissions needed

4. for windows simply run `win-run.bat` and for linux do the following `chmod +x linux-run.sh` then `./linux-run.sh` (untested I tink those commands work). All requirements will be installed (you can disable this by setting skip-installation to true)

# KNOWN BUGS

`Economy game` - Restarting the bot while users have crops planted WILL wipe all data of planted crops (users will loose all the crops they planted)

`Buttons` - Buttons will no longer work after a bot restart (ticket button and verify button)

`json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)` - Just delete whatever json file is erroring (only happens with empty json files)
